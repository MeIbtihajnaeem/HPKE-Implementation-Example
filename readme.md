# HPKE Implementation Evaluation Report

## Introduction

This report provides an overview of the implementation of the Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) protocol, following the specifications outlined in RFC 9180. HPKE is a cryptographic protocol designed to facilitate secure communication over insecure channels. The focus of this report is to detail the coding implementation of HPKE, which includes test.js, test_vector.js, and result.txt files.

## Implementation Details

### test.js

The test.js file serves as the primary test script for evaluating the functionality of HPKE. It leverages modules such as chai for assertions, @hpke/core for core HPKE functionality, @hpke/dhkem-x25519 for key encapsulation, and crypto for cryptographic operations. The test case within test.js initializes the HPKE CipherSuite with specific algorithms for key encapsulation, key derivation, and authenticated encryption with associated data. It then proceeds to generate random parameters required for encryption and decryption, and finally executes the HPKE encryption and decryption processes using the provided parameters.

### test_vector.js

The test_vector.js file contains the core HPKE functionality encapsulated within an asynchronous function named doHPKE(). This function accepts parameters such as mode, initial key encapsulation key, pre-shared key, pre-shared key identifier, information for encryption, and the message to be encrypted. Within the function, the CipherSuite is initialized with the specified algorithms, key pairs for sender and recipient are generated, encryption and decryption contexts are created, and the encryption and decryption operations are performed.

### result.txt

The result.txt file presents the output of a sample test run utilizing the implemented HPKE functionality. It includes details such as the completion status of initialization, mode, identifiers for key encapsulation, key derivation, and authenticated encryption with associated data, as well as the encrypted and decrypted messages.

## Conclusion

The implemented solution effectively demonstrates the functionality of HPKE by securely encrypting and decrypting messages using the specified algorithms and parameters. The test results provided in result.txt indicate successful encryption and decryption processes, thereby validating the correctness and efficacy of the implementation in facilitating secure communication.
